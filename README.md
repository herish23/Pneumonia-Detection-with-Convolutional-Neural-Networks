# Pneumonia Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and testing with random images from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. The project also helps user to look through the images which are classified abnormal. In the example 10 classified images was illustrated in `predicted_images.png`

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x // 3.7 as example
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Requests
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).These dataset was used in example but you may also you any dataset and tweak the code accordingly
- labels
- X_train , X_test
- y_train ,y_test

## Usage
For GPU/CPU acceleration you may use other notebooks else if your system can support.

To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:
